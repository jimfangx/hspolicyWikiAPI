Her enthusiasm and hands-on approach are a great match for the Sci.Bio team, and we’re all excited to see her take us to the next phase.” On joining Sci.Bio, Perna says: “This opportunity is a great match. I thrive in an entrepreneurial environment, which is a big part of the Sci.Bio culture. And, I can continue serving an industry I am deeply rooted in while doing what I enjoy—bringing visibility to growing companies.” In her highly visible position at MassBio, Perna built relationships across the industry and became a resource to life sciences professionals. “I helped individuals progress in their careers, and I worked with companies scaling up. I am excited to continue being a part of that, just from a different perspective. The life sciences recruiting market is hot, but Sci.Bio has a unique recruiting model and I think there’s a great story to share,” Perna said. Perna received her BA from Fordham University with a degree in Communications and American Studies. She also completed the Emerging Leaders Program at UMass Boston in 2014. Over the past year she earned numerous certifications in marketing and social media.\n(Eric Celidonio and Lauren E. Perna, 2017, “Corporate Espionage Part 1: When The Interview Process Becomes An Opportunity For Intellectual Property Theft,” Sci.Bio Recruiting, https://www.sci.bio/when-the-interview-process-becomes-an-opportunity-for-intellectual-property-theft-part-1/.)\nMarc was the perfect candidate for a principal scientist job that we were having a difficult time filling. On paper, he was a well-qualified molecular biologist with degrees from top universities and impressive biochemistry skills. When our lead recruiter reached out to him, he played hard to get, but after a couple of attempts, he agreed to come in for an onsite interview. Marc acted strangely during his interview–he was more interested in the facility than the actual job, frequently glanced around at his surroundings, and he asked a number of questions not related to the role. Marc also requested a tour of the lab, which was provided by a junior team member. By the end of the interview, it was clear that he wasn’t a fit for the role. In fact, despite his impressive credentials on paper, he didn’t seem to have any transferable skills or interest in the role. While most of the interviewers chalked up Marc’s strange demeanor to just being a poor candidate for the job, it turns out that Marc wasn’t there for a new job. He was using the interview process to access intellectual property for a foreign competitor. Marc used the opportunity to gain access to key, confidential information. He even stole a couple of USB drives as well as documentation when he was left alone in an interviewer’s office and when he walked unescorted to the restroom. He also brought an inexpensive pen camera with a microphone to record the discussion, effectively delivering accurate, sensitive detail with minimal effort. \n(IP) theft \nAND\nNow that we’ve told our real-life tale of a biotechnology spy, in the next section we’ll review other ways companies could open themselves up for IP theft.\nThe US biopharmaceutical industry is key to global medical and life sciences innovation.\nAtkinson 19 – Robert D.
